Android-Open-Radio - Radio App for Android
----------------------------------

Android-Open-Radio is a bare bones app for listening to radio programs over the internet. The app stores stations as files on your device's external storage. It currently understands streams encoded in MP3 and OGG.

Important note: This is an app of type BYOS ("bring your own station"). It does not feature any kind of built-in search option. You will have to manually add radio stations.

Android-Open-Radio is free software. It is published under the [MIT open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Want to help? Please check out the notes in [CONTRIBUTE.md](https://github.com/malah-code/Android-Open-Radio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md) first.
