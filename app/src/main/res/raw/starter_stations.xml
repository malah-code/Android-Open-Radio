----------
&gt; From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia BBC Arabic may refer to the
&gt; Literary Arabic language radio station run by the BBC World Service,
&gt; as well as the BBC's satellite TV channel, and the website that serves
&gt; as an Literary Arabic language news portal and provides online access
&gt; to both the TV and radio broadcasts. The radio service is broadcast
&gt; from Broadcasting House in London as well as from a BBC Bureau in
&gt; Cairo. The target audience is the Middle East and North Africa.

**History**

&gt; Origins In 1936, the BBC helped the British Colonial Office set up the
&gt; Palestine Broadcasting Service in Jerusalem, a medium wave radio
&gt; broadcast. This was created as a way to broadcast British views to the
&gt; Arab world. This was partly in response to the Italian Literary Arabic
&gt; language radio broadcasts that were transmitted by medium wave from
&gt; Bari, and also in short wave from Rome, beginning in 1934. After the
&gt; Second Italo-Abyssinian War, these broadcasts became strongly
&gt; anti-British.[1] In the years leading up to the 1938 establishment of
&gt; the BBC Literary Arabic language service, there were plans by the
&gt; British Foreign Office to set up radio broadcasts based in
&gt; Cyprus.[2][3]Cyprus at the time was a Crown Colony in the British
&gt; Empire, and seen as more stable than Palestine, a British Mandate.[4]
&gt; Also during this time, the BBC was insistent that its established news
&gt; standards not be compromised in the name of broadcasting
&gt; Arabic-language British propaganda.[3][5] In 1938, 16 years after the
&gt; British Broadcasting Corporation was founded, the BBC began
&gt; broadcasting in Literary Arabic.[3][6][7] BBC Arabic is considered one
&gt; of the oldest and longest running foreign-language news services.
